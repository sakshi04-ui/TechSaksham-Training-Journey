# üíª SQL & Python - Fun & Engaging Learning Notes üéâ

Welcome, fellow code warriors! üöÄ Ever wondered how to make SQL and Python dance together like an awkward couple at prom? Well, buckle up because this ride will be as fun as debugging at 2 AM! Let's jump into the world of databases, queries, joins, subqueries, and Python integration with a sprinkle of humor!

## üîÆ SQL Joins - The "Matchmaker" of Databases

Joins in SQL are like Tinder but for tables ‚Äì they help us match rows from different tables based on related columns. Here are the different types:

1. **INNER JOIN** - The "Common Interests" join. Only shows rows that have a match in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)** - The "Always Picks the Left Side" join. Shows all rows from the left table and matches from the right.
3. **RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** - The "Always Picks the Right Side" join. Opposite of LEFT JOIN.
4. **FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)** - The "Everyone's Invited" join. Shows all rows from both tables.
5. **CROSS JOIN** - The "Match Everything" join. Pairs each row from one table with every row from another (great for chaos lovers).
6. **SELF JOIN** - The "Talking to Yourself" join. A table joins with itself (just like we do when debugging).
7. **NATURAL JOIN** - The "Magic Match" join. Automatically matches columns with the same name.

### üî® Example - Employee & Manager Relationship (SELF JOIN)

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp (
    eid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR(20),
    designation VARCHAR(200),
    bid INT
);

INSERT INTO emp VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Dev', 6), 
(2, 'Abc', 'Dev', 6),
(3, 'Rocky', 'Dev', 6),
(4, 'Bhai', 'Dev', 6), 
(5, 'Rahul', 'Tester', 8), 
(6, 'Xyz', 'D-Manager', 9), 
(7, 'Shelar', 'Tester', 8), 
(8, 'Tom', 'T-Manager', 9),
(9, 'Akshay', 'CEO', NULL);
```

Find employees and their managers:

```sql
SELECT a.ename AS employee, a.designation, b.ename AS manager, b.designation 
FROM emp AS a 
JOIN emp AS b ON a.bid = b.eid;
```

## üîç Subqueries - "Inception in SQL"

A subquery is like an SQL query inside another SQL query‚Äîjust like a dream within a dream! They are used when a query depends on another query for its results. üòµ‚Äçüí´

### üìå Types of Subqueries:
1. **Scalar Subquery** - Returns a single value. Like a "magic crystal ball" that predicts only one answer.
2. **Single-row Subquery** - Returns one row. Like asking, "Who's the top student in the class?"
3. **Multi-row Subquery** - Returns multiple rows. Like asking, "Who got more than 90 marks?"
4. **Correlated Subquery** - Runs once per row processed by the outer query. Like checking "Is this product the most expensive in its category?"

### üî• Example - Finding the Second-Highest Salary (The Classic)

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

Here, the inner query finds the highest salary, and the outer query finds the max salary that is **less than** the highest salary, making it the second-highest salary. üî•

## üîë Creating New Users in MySQL (a.k.a Giving People Database Passes)

So you want to create a new user? Here's how you do it:

```sql
CREATE USER 'user12'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user12';
```

üëâ *This creates a user named `user12` with password `user12` (feel free to use a more secure password unless you enjoy hackers).* 

**Granting Permissions:** (So the user doesn‚Äôt just stare at an empty database)

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON wit.emp TO 'user12'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, DELETE ON wit.emp TO 'user12'@'localhost';
GRANT SELECT, DELETE ON wit.* TO 'user12'@'localhost';
```

**Taking Away Permissions:** (Because power should be taken responsibly)

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, DELETE ON wit.* FROM 'user12'@'localhost';
REVOKE SELECT, DELETE ON wit.emp FROM 'user12'@'localhost';
```

## üß™ SQL Meets Python - The "Odd Couple"

SQL and Python work together like Sherlock and Watson. Python is the brain, SQL is the database. Here's how to make them talk:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (or nothing will work!)

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install pymysql
```

### Step 2: Establish Connection (Don't ghost your database!)

```python
import pymysql

myconn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='yourpassword'
)

print(myconn)  # If this prints something other than an error, congrats, you're connected!
```

### Step 3: Create a Cursor (Like an Intern That Runs SQL Queries)

```python
cur = myconn.cursor()
cur.execute('CREATE DATABASE pywit')
```

### Step 4: Use the Database

```python
myconn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='yourpassword',
    database='pywit'
)
cur = myconn.cursor()
cur.execute('SHOW TABLES')
for i in cur:
    print(i)
```

### Step 5: Insert Data (Like Filling Out Forms, But Less Boring)

```python
cur.execute('INSERT INTO newhaha(id, name, age) VALUES(%s, %s, %s)', (1, 'Sakshi', 20))
myconn.commit()  # Don't forget this, or your data will disappear faster than free snacks at work!
```

## üîç Key Takeaways (a.k.a. "Don't Forget This, Seriously!")

- **Always close your database connection!**
  ```python
  myconn.close()
  ```
- **Use `commit()` after insert/update/delete operations.**
- **Always handle exceptions, or your code will cry.**
  ```python
  try:
      cur.execute('SELECT * FROM users')
  except Exception as e:
      print("Oops!", e)
  ```
- **Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL Injection.**
- **Natural Join is like a blind date; it assumes things will match!**
- **SELF JOIN is like looking in the mirror and talking to yourself.**
- **Grant only necessary permissions to users!**
- **INNER JOIN is the VIP section ‚Äì only matching records get in.**

## üöÄ Final Words

If you made it this far, congrats! You're now on your way to mastering SQL and Python like a boss! üòé Keep practicing, break some queries (intentionally, of course), and happy coding!
