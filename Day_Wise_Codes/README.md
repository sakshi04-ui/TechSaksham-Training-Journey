- Provide a collection of scripts that can be reused or modified for similar tasks.  

## 📂 Structure  

- **Linux Scripts:**  
  Scripts for basic and advanced Linux operations, including shell scripting examples.  

- **Python Programs:**  
  - Core Python: Practice codes for basic syntax, loops, functions, and more.
