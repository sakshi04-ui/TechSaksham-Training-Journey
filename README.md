# üöÄ TechSaksham Training Journey  

Welcome to my repository documenting my **TechSaksham Training Program** journey, a collaborative initiative by Microsoft and SAP. This repository contains all the resources, notes, and hands-on practice files I've created during the intensive 15-day program.  

## üìú About the Program  
The TechSaksham program is a skill-building initiative designed to equip students with in-demand technical knowledge. Over 15 days, I‚Äôve been learning and applying concepts in:  
- **Linux Operating System & Shell Scripting**  
- **Python (Core and Advanced)**  
- **Relational Databases (CRUD Operations with Python)**  

## üìÇ Repository Structure   

- **`Day-wise Notes`**: Contains detailed notes for each day's topics, including commands, examples, and solutions.  
- **`Shell Scripts`**: Sample scripts written during the Linux shell scripting sessions.  
- **`Python Projects`**: Practice programs and mini-projects developed during Python lessons.  
- **`Assessments`**: Code snippets and problem-solving tasks from baseline and mid-session tests.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered  

### Day 1 Highlights  
- Installed and configured **Ubuntu on VirtualBox**.  
- Basic Linux commands: `pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cd`, `cat`, `nano`, `vi`.  
- Introduction to **Shell Scripting**: Wrote and executed basic scripts.  
- Created scripts to calculate sums, multiplications, and more.  

Check out the **`Day-1` folder** for detailed scripts and notes.  

### Day 2 Onwards  
- Advanced Python concepts, CRUD operations with databases, and more (details to be added as the training progresses).
